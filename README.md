# GitIntro Practice
Using git to track how I do the template vector class
## Practices
Lists several things to try out using git
### Creating a different branch than master
When trying out and changing things that we wish will not be implement before we are sure of it, we can create a new branch and try on thet branch. In this case, I created a test branch.
### Creating an .gitignore file
In the test branch, I managed to create a text file that is being put in gitignore.
### Create new branch and solving non-fastforward merges
When forgetting to pull before push, we might run into merging conflicts, if we change both the remote and the local at the same time.
